        <h3>Cyber security professionals should have an in-depth understanding of the following types of cyber security
            threats. </h3>
    </center>

        <h2>
            <li>Malware</li>
        </h2>
        <p>Malware is malicious software such as spyware, ransomware, viruses and worms. Malware is activated when a
            user
            clicks on a malicious link or attachment, which leads to installing dangerous software. Cisco reports that
            malware, once activated, can:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Block access to key network components (ransomware)</li>
            <li>Install additional harmful software</li>
            <li>Covertly obtain information by transmitting data from the hard drive (spyware)</li>
            <li>Disrupt individual parts, making the system inoperable</li>
        </ul>
        <br><br>

        <h2>
            <li>Emotet</li>
        </h2>
        <p>The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) describes Emotet as “an advanced, modular banking
            Trojan that primarily functions as a downloader or dropper of other banking Trojans. Emotet continues to be
            among the most costly and destructive malware.”</p>

        <h2>
            <li>Denial of Serivce</li>
        </h2>
        <p>A denial of service (DoS) is a type of cyber attack that floods a computer or network so it cannot respond to
            requests. A distributed DoS (DDoS) does the same thing, but the attack originates from a computer network.
            Cyber attackers often use a flood attack to disrupt the “handshake” process and carry out a DoS. </p>

        <h2>
            <li>Man in the Middle</li>
        </h2>
        <p>A man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack occurs when hackers insert themselves into a two-party transaction. After
            interrupting the traffic, they can filter and steal data, according to Cisco. MITM attacks often occur when
            a visitor uses an unsecured public Wi-Fi network. Attackers insert themselves between the visitor and the
            network, and then use malware to install software and use data maliciously.</p>

        <h2>
            <li>Phishing</li>
        </h2>
        <p>Phishing attacks use fake communication, such as an email, to trick the receiver into opening it and carrying
            out the instructions inside, such as providing a credit card number. “The goal is to steal sensitive data
            like credit card and login information or to install malware on the victim's machine,” Cisco reports.</p>
